Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been used as a non-invasive method for examining
brain states related to cognition and behaviour, but its use has traditionally been limited by
cost, technical complexity, and laboratory constraints. In recent years, the development of
portable and relatively affordable EEG devices, such as the Muse headset, has expanded
the potential for studying neural activity in more naturalistic settings. The goal of the present
study was to design a desktop-based data collection system, developed largely with the
assistance of Cursor AI, to record and analyze EEG activity during athletic performance and
to examine whether portable EEG could capture neural patterns associated with successful
performance. 

Basketball free-throw shooting was used as a precision sport task due to its
well-defined preparation and execution phases. EEG activity was recorded using a
four-channel Muse device (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10) during free throws, and neural data were
segmented into pre-shot, execution, and post-shot periods. Frequency band power (delta,
theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) was extracted using Butterworth bandpass filters applied
within a sliding 1-second analysis window and averaged across channels to yield global
power estimates. Rather than focusing on localized sensorimotor activity or coherence
between regions, this study aimed to identify global, pre-performance EEG patterns that
could serve as a potential "readiness marker" prior to shot execution, with successful and
unsuccessful shots compared to assess whether these patterns differed as a function of
outcome. This work represents an initial step toward validating portable EEG as a tool for
monitoring performance-relevant neural states in ecologically valid athletic environments.
