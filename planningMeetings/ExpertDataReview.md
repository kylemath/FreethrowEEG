# Expert Data Review: Brain Wave Analysis
Date: April 2, 2025
Session ID: session_001_20250402_002510
Experts: Dr. Sarah Chen (EEG Research), Michael Thompson (Basketball Performance)

## Normal EEG Wave Ranges (For Reference)
- Delta (0.5-4 Hz): 0.5-4 μV during waking state
- Theta (4-8 Hz): 4-8 μV during focused tasks
- Alpha (8-13 Hz): 6-12 μV during relaxed alertness
- Beta (13-32 Hz): 10-20 μV during active thinking
- Gamma (32+ Hz): 15-35 μV during peak performance

## Expert Discussion

**Dr. Chen**: Let's focus on the brain wave patterns from this session. Looking at the pre-shot phase, I notice some concerning patterns. The delta waves are averaging around 7-8 μV, which is significantly higher than what we'd expect during an active performance state. Normal delta activity should be minimal during focused athletic performance.

**Michael**: That's interesting from a basketball perspective. High delta waves often indicate deep relaxation or sleep-like states. Could this suggest the player is too relaxed or perhaps mentally fatigued?

**Dr. Chen**: Exactly. The theta waves are also elevated, ranging from 5-7 μV. While not as concerning as the delta activity, it's still higher than optimal for a focused athletic task. The alpha waves, however, are within a reasonable range at 4-5 μV, though slightly on the lower end.

**Michael**: I see the beta waves are around 13-16 μV during pre-shot and during-shot phases, which seems within normal range. That's somewhat reassuring since beta is associated with active thinking and motor control.

**Dr. Chen**: Yes, the beta activity is one of the more normal aspects here. The gamma waves are also within expected ranges at 20-25 μV, which is good news since gamma is crucial for peak performance. However, I'm particularly concerned about the sustained high delta activity across all phases.

**Michael**: From a performance standpoint, should we be worried about these patterns? Especially that elevated delta activity?

**Dr. Chen**: Yes, I believe we should. These readings suggest the player might be experiencing one of several issues:
1. Mental fatigue
2. Excessive relaxation
3. Possible technical issues with the EEG readings
4. Underlying physiological factors affecting brain activity

**Michael**: What would you recommend as next steps? Should we verify the equipment first?

**Dr. Chen**: Absolutely. Before making any training recommendations, we should:
1. Verify the EEG equipment is properly calibrated
2. Run a baseline test in a controlled setting
3. Check the electrode connections and impedance levels
4. Consider potential environmental factors affecting the readings

The unusually high delta waves during an active task warrant careful investigation before we draw definitive conclusions about performance implications.
