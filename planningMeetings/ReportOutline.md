## Key Points to Highlight

1. **Relative Changes vs. Absolute Values**: Emphasize that despite elevated baseline readings, the relative changes in brain wave activity during different phases are meaningful and provide valuable insights.

2. **Phase-Specific Patterns**: Highlight the distinct brain wave patterns observed during pre-shot, during-shot, and post-shot phases, particularly the decrease in delta waves during execution.

3. **Performance Correlations**: Focus on the correlations between specific brain wave patterns and successful shots, especially:
   - Stable alpha wave patterns (28-35 μV) during pre-shot for made shots
   - 15-20% increase in beta wave activity during shot execution for successful attempts
   - Higher gamma wave levels (25-35 μV) during made shots

4. **Theta-Alpha Ratio**: Emphasize this as a potentially reliable indicator of optimal mental state for free throw shooting.

5. **Adaptation and Learning**: Discuss the progressive improvement in wave pattern management over the course of the session, suggesting potential for training and adaptation.

## Technical Considerations to Address

1. **Recording Challenges**: Acknowledge the potential issues with electrode placement, movement artifacts, and environmental factors, but emphasize that meaningful patterns were still observable.

2. **Methodological Refinements**: Discuss the recommended improvements for future data collection, including:
   - Standardized electrode placement protocols
   - Movement stabilization techniques
   - Environmental controls
   - Baseline calibration procedures

3. **Individual Differences**: Note that brain wave patterns can vary significantly between individuals, and the absolute values may be less important than the relative changes and patterns.

## Visual Elements to Consider

1. **Wave Pattern Graphs**: Include visual representations of the brain wave patterns during different phases of successful vs. unsuccessful shots.

2. **Phase Comparison Charts**: Create charts comparing delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma wave levels across pre-shot, during-shot, and post-shot phases.

3. **Theta-Alpha Ratio Visualization**: Develop a graph showing the relationship between theta-alpha ratios and shot outcomes.

4. **Progressive Adaptation Chart**: Illustrate the gradual decrease in delta and theta wave amplitudes over the course of the session.

## Final Thoughts

The data presents a fascinating window into the mental processes involved in free throw shooting. Despite the technical challenges, the patterns observed provide valuable insights that could inform training strategies and performance enhancement techniques. The relative changes in brain wave activity, particularly the decrease in delta waves during shot execution and the theta-alpha ratio patterns, offer promising directions for future research and practical applications.

I recommend focusing your report on these relative changes and patterns rather than the absolute values, which may be affected by recording issues. Emphasize the practical implications for training and performance, and acknowledge the limitations while highlighting the meaningful insights that can still be derived from the data.
