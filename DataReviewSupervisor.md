# Data Review Meeting: FreethrowEEG Project
## Discussion between Dr. Sarah Chen (Basketball Biomechanics) and Dr. Alex Park (EEG/Neuroscience)

_Setting: Lab meeting room, reviewing initial data from the FreethrowEEG project_

### Initial Data Review

Sarah: _(examining the shot timing data)_ "I'm seeing consistent intervals between shots, which is good for standardization, but I'm a bit concerned about the rhythm feeling unnatural for experienced players."

Alex: _(looking at EEG traces)_ "Interesting point. I'm actually seeing some unusual patterns in the beta band that might be related to that. The beta power is consistently higher than expected - around 25-50 µV² - which could indicate muscle tension or cognitive stress."

Sarah: _(nodding)_ "That makes sense. In natural free throw routines, players usually have their own timing. Some take quick shots, others have longer routines. Are we maybe over-constraining them?"

Alex: "The EEG data suggests we might be. Look at these pre-shot baselines - the beta-to-alpha ratio is much higher than what we typically see in focused states. It's almost like they're in a state of prepared tension rather than relaxed readiness."

Sarah: "Right! Elite shooters usually show a more relaxed pre-shot phase. The current 5-second mandatory wait might be too rigid. What if we modified the protocol?"

Alex: _(examining signal quality indicators)_ "I'm also seeing some data quality issues we should address. The forehead sensors especially are showing higher noise levels than optimal."

### Key Observations

**Basketball Mechanics:**
- Shot timing is too rigid
- Natural player routines are being disrupted
- Pre-shot tension may be affecting performance

**EEG Data Quality:**
- Elevated beta band power (25-50 µV²)
- Suboptimal alpha-to-beta ratios
- Some sensor noise issues
- Delta and theta bands showing expected ranges
- Good overall signal continuity

### Recommendations

1. **Protocol Adjustments:**
   - Allow variable pre-shot timing (5-15 seconds)
   - Let players establish their natural routine
   - Keep only the shot completion beep
   - Add a "ready" button players can press when settled

2. **EEG Setup Improvements:**
   - Add impedance check before each block of 10 shots
   - Implement real-time beta band monitoring
   - Create visual feedback for excessive muscle tension
   - Adjust headband fitting protocol

3. **Data Collection Enhancements:**
   - Add baseline recording of player's natural free throw routine without equipment
   - Include rest periods between blocks for clean baseline measurements
   - Record player comfort ratings after each session
   - Implement automated artifact detection for movement

4. **Analysis Pipeline Updates:**
   - Add muscle artifact rejection specifically for beta band
   - Create power ratio visualizations (alpha/beta, theta/beta)
   - Implement shot-by-shot quality metrics
   - Compare timing variations with success rate

### Next Steps

Sarah: "Should we run a pilot with these changes?"

Alex: "Yes, I'd suggest a single-session pilot with 3-4 players, testing the variable timing protocol. We can compare the EEG patterns with our current data."

Sarah: "Good idea. I can also film their natural free throw routines before we add any equipment, give us a baseline for timing and movement patterns."

Alex: "Perfect. Let's also add some basic questionnaires about comfort and perceived impact on their routine. The beta band data suggests there's some adaptation stress we should track."

### Action Items

1. Update protocol documentation with flexible timing
2. Develop comfort/feedback questionnaire
3. Create new baseline recording protocol
4. Modify EEG preprocessing pipeline
5. Schedule pilot sessions with 3-4 players
6. Review results in one week

_Note: All modifications should prioritize maintaining data quality while reducing artificial constraints on natural player behavior._

### Recent Session Review (March 25, 2025)

Sarah: _(reviewing new session data)_ "Let's look at this latest session from player '001'. What stands out to you in the EEG patterns?"

Alex: _(analyzing the data)_ "The most striking feature is the beta band activity during the successful shot. We're seeing values between 3-8 µV² in the pre-shot phase, which is actually much better than our previous sessions where we saw 25-50 µV²."

Sarah: "That's a significant improvement! How about the alpha-to-beta ratio?"

Alex: "Yes, that's interesting too. During the successful shot, we see alpha levels around 0.2-0.6 µV², giving us a more balanced alpha-to-beta ratio. This suggests the player achieved a better state of 'relaxed focus' compared to the tense state we were seeing before."

Sarah: _(examining shot timing)_ "I notice the delta and theta bands show good baseline activity. Could this indicate better adaptation to the timing protocol?"

Alex: "Exactly. The delta values around 0.05-0.8 µV² and theta at 0.1-0.6 µV² suggest a stable baseline state. However, I'm still seeing some brief spikes in the gamma band during the shot phase, likely related to muscle activity."

### Additional Observations

**Improvements:**
- Lower beta band power (3-8 µV² vs previous 25-50 µV²)
- Better alpha-to-beta ratio indicating improved focus
- Stable baseline in delta and theta bands
- Successful shot execution with improved neural patterns

**Remaining Concerns:**
- Some gamma band activity during shot execution
- Brief muscle artifacts still present
- Limited sample size (2 shots) makes it harder to establish patterns

### Updated Recommendations

1. **Short-term Adjustments:**
   - Continue with current headband positioning as it's showing improved signal quality
   - Consider extending session length beyond 2 shots for better pattern recognition
   - Monitor gamma band specifically during shot execution

2. **Data Collection Refinements:**
   - Add markers for player's perceived comfort level
   - Track time spent in "ready" state before shot initiation
   - Compare successful shot patterns with this session's baseline

Sarah: "Should we use this session's successful shot pattern as a reference for optimal neural state?"

Alex: "It's promising, but I'd want to see more shots with similar patterns before establishing it as a benchmark. The improved beta levels are particularly encouraging though."

### Next Review Items

1. Gather more sessions with similar EEG patterns
2. Compare gamma band activity across multiple successful shots
3. Analyze temporal relationship between alpha surge and shot initiation
4. Document player feedback on comfort and timing

_Note: The improved beta band values suggest we're moving in the right direction with our protocol adjustments._
